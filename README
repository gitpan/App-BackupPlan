App::BackupPlan version 0.0.1
=======================

App::BackupPlan - Perl extension for automated, regular backups

App::BackupPlan is a simple module to perform regular, selective and automated 
backups of your system. It requires an xml file with the
specification of your backup plan, logically divided into independent tasks.
The constructor also takes a log4perl configuration file, to customise the logging produced.
This can be omitted if the default logging behaviour is desired.
By setting up a regular back-up task using cron or similar, and by configuring a backup plan with different
tasks, backup frequencies and max number of files retained, it is possible to achieve a regular
and incremental backup of different part of your system, without too much trouble. 


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

USAGE

This perl module was written with an automated backup functionality in mind. So, even if it can
be run manually and on demand, it is best suited to be integrated in a regular batch (overnight maybe)
or even better as a cron task. To facilitate this task there is a script client in the bin
directory of this distribution, backup.pl, which can be easily scheduled as cron task. 


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

XML::DOM for parsing the configuration file,

Log::Log4perl for logging,

File::Find to collect the entire content of a directory substructure when using Archive::Tar

Archive::Tar to perform perl based tar, instead of using system tar

tar executable used in Linux environment for storage and compression
